# Expo Index Converted (Ready)

This project was converted from your React + Vite app to an **Expo React Native** app and prepared so you can run it locally.

Steps to run (exact):
1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install` (Node 18+ recommended)
2. Start Expo:
   - `npx expo start`  or `npm start`
3. Open with Expo Go (Android/iOS) or run on an emulator.

Everything needed is included except `node_modules`. After `npm install`, `expo start` will open the app.

Notes:
- Expo SDK: 49
- To use native features (avatar picker) you may need to grant permissions on the device.
- If you want the project completely preinstalled (node_modules included), I can provide guidance, but it is standard to run `npm install` locally.
